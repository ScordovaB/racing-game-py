# 3D Racing Game created with Ursina

## Game buttons: press "W" to speed up, press "Q" to turn left, press "E" to turn right, press "S" to go in reverse and press "space" to brake
## 
# To RUN the GAME:
## Run the game from the "__init__.py" file, make sure you have the whole folder, INCLUDING the folder VENV , to get the modified Ursina library. RUN it from the Virtual Environment
### In case you can't run it from the venv foler, the game will not function correctly (meaning the car would not continue to move without pushing a key), then add manually to the FirstPersonController.py which its inside the Ursina library where all your python packages are, THEN add this on the line 44.
